# thamesmix 0.1.1

Second cran submission.

## New features

* `thames_mixtures()` added which computes an estimate for the reciprocal marginal likelihood

* `overlapgraph()` added which computes the overlap graph and criterion of overlap (co)

* `compute_nobile_identity()` added which estimates the log marginal likelihood

* `alltopsorts_recursion()` added which computes all topological orderings

## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* removed the command par() in all files, vignettes and demos,

* added 3 optional parameters to thames_mixtures.
