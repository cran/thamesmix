\title{Calculates the set I(G) described in Metodiev et al. (2025)
as well as the limit on the complexity of the THAMES associated with it.}
\usage{
calc_non_I_set(scaling, G, sims, c_opt)
}
\arguments{
\item{scaling}{list of fit determined via QDA (means and covariances)}

\item{G}{number of components}

\item{sims}{n_simul x G x (u+1) array of parameters sampled from
the posterior, where
  n_simul is the number of simulations from the posterior,
  G       is the number of components,
  u       is the number of mixture component parameters
          (parameter u+1 is the mixture weight)}

\item{c_opt}{radius of the ellipsoid E from Metodiev et al. (2025)}
}
\value{
a named list with the following elements:
         graph:                  the overlap graph for G
         non_I_set:              the complement of the set I(G)
         complexity_limit_estim: an upper bound on the THAMES complexity
         graphmat:               adjacency matrix of the overlap graph for G
}
\description{
Calculates the set I(G) described in Metodiev et al. (2025)
